            <h4>Version 2.0</h4>
            There were some details in the resource pack that caused the font to not display correctly in Minecraft. In this version, due to the fact that the correct display was a priority, corrections were made and the shape of the glyphs was tried to be more similar to the original version of Rooyin font. Added font version so that this package can be used in Minecraft version 1.20. Versions were limited to avoid confusion, and Bedrock versions were merged and could be changed in-game.

    <li>Correcting the shape of letters for beauty and correct display</li>
    <li>Added "Font" version</li>
    <li>Fixing the problem and making the range of letters more complete</li>
    <li>Merging versions of Bedrock Edition</li>

        <h4>Version 1.0.1</h4>
        In this version, the focus was on making the letters more beautiful and complete to support Minecraft languages.

        <h4>Version 1.0</h4>
        The resource pack has been released!
